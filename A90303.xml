         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Need not to in≈øi≈øt much upon my di≈øcour≈øe, all people ≈øo well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature of the object, to an≈øwer whom is now my taske in this onely ≈øheet of paper: more monyes I have not to ≈øpend ≈øo much in vaine (notwith≈øtanding Mr. Lilbornes great reports of Salleryes receiving from England) which is well knowne to the contrary, neither have I ≈øuch col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, beggings, and continual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits which Mr. Lilborne weekly reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves from his Brother hood and faction in England, by rea≈ø≈øon I give not ≈øuch advi≈øe in my letters to tho≈øe of England as he doth weekly, which He takes the impudency to Iu≈øtifie the ≈øame in part of his pamphlets, by a litle you may judge of the re≈øt, He is ≈øo much an Engli≈øhman as ever He was, not to have King nor States to doe harme to his Brother rebells and traytors in England, to that end he writs to ≈øome in England his oppinions concerning ≈øea and Land ≈øervice which may fall out cro≈øs to the de≈øignes of the rebells enemies of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. The Proverb often times prooves truth, <hi>That a Standerby ≈øees better then he that plaies,</hi> to that end he remaines among≈øt the Parliaments friends to give aime again≈øt both our King, and the States of the≈øe united Provinces, being between both. But had I ≈øuch ≈øumes of moneys as he reports, he ≈øhould have heard un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly from me ere this; having had 24. ≈øheets of Paper ready for the pre≈øs the≈øe 9. monthes in two volumes, the one Intituled.<lb/>

            <p>The Pro≈øpective Gla≈øs for King and ≈øubjects to have layn Printed 9. monthes in the Printers hands and not ≈øent them into the World imediatly after their birth, where in Mr. Lylborne is more at larg di≈øcovered, his cruelty and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øme laid open to all readers.</p>
            <p>But why doe I hold thee in the porch (Courteious reader) when the hou≈øe is ≈øo litle. Therefore welcom to the re≈øt, and in briefe, who ≈øo hath, or ≈øhall plea≈øe to read the 8 page of Mr Lilbornes letter directed to Mr D.D. in the united Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, may find the tearme he gives me. of Spy of Cromwells and Scotts, and ≈øayeth my booke intituled <hi>The unexpected Life,</hi> (given by Lilborne and his faction) and the long <hi>wished for death of the thing called Parliament in England,</hi> is fal≈øe and on purpo≈øs, to have his throate cutt, ≈øo that no man mu≈øt write or ≈øpeake what he hath done for that cau≈øe. But let me tell Mr Lilborne, that what I write in that booke again≈øt him, and ten times more then I ≈øhall here in≈øert, that tho≈øe he ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes Cavaliers here, and els where, knowes to be too great a truth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more he goes about to vaile his former, and ≈øtill vilany, He will but give him ≈øelfe the lye. For hath not many
<pb facs="tcp:157737:3"/>told him to his face the ≈øame; and doth not all know that John Lylborne (when he was but an aprenti≈øe boy in London) was one of the very fir≈øt (if not the fir≈øt) that ever endeavored to make a ≈øeparation between the late murthered King and his People: The Dutch al≈øo can not be ignorant thereof, for, for that very cau≈øe did he fly in to the≈øe Lands, and his re≈øidence was here in Delph, and my printer was his in tho≈øe dayes, &amp; he made a Burgur here of Delph at the ≈øame time. O yes you (Mr Lylborne) are very well known to be the in≈øurecter in chiefe, and him who brought great tumults to white Hall that had not Capt: <hi>Endimion Porter</hi> immediatly with his trayn band, the Nobility and Stout-hearted gentery in Court a≈ø≈øi≈øted each other, the ≈øence murthered King, his Queene and Royal progenie had undoubtedly been then murthered, ≈øo that you had ≈øaved the murtherurs at We≈øtmin≈øter a great deale of Honor, and co≈øtly trouble to the 3 Kingdomes: It is likewi≈øe known to all at home and a broad of your owne nation, that after that in≈øurrection again≈øt the King &amp;c. in the rebellious city of London and Southwarke you did ray≈øe the ≈øame rable, and (had not the traine bands likewi≈øe prevented) vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently fell on Lambeth Hou≈øe and have kild his Grace of Canterbury, though ≈øence butchered by your bretheren. And doth not the three nations ring of you (Mr Lylborne) for cau≈ø≈øing libells to be throun in his Maje≈øtyes coach, as he pa≈øt the ≈øtreets of London, and doe not all know you were one of the fir≈øt Actors in the late bloody warre, and death of the late murthered King, ever po≈øting betwixt the Divells in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and the Turks in London, but of this more at large els where; And for the pre≈ø≈øent I reffer the reader to your owne workes (Iack) of 44. bookes by you printed, or at lea≈øt owned (in your <hi>Appologie</hi>) and ≈øence: in all of which, if there be not Trea≈øon, Con≈øpiricie Fal≈øe Doctrine and Heri≈øy, this is not truth, e≈øpecialy by rea≈øon my memory is fre≈øh with your pampehlet from <hi>Viana</hi> in May la≈øt, wherein if any plea≈øe to view the 12 pag they may find your a≈øpertions on the pre≈øent King, and your fixe Re≈øolutions again≈øt the Scotts King (as you term him) to be irrevocable; and you (Iacke) take pre≈øumtion upon you there to ≈øet downe the rea≈øons, and in the ≈øame page ≈øay that you will not lo≈øe your party, to ≈øet his Intere≈øt on foote; in a word all your pamphlets are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øed of nought elce but ≈øeditious names, of Tyrannie and oppre≈ø≈øion in monarchy, and you cloake all your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion under hone≈øt <hi>magna Charta,</hi> which had tho≈øe valiant old <hi>Britanes</hi> thought it ≈øhould have beene ≈øo much abu≈øed by ≈øuch evile Spirits as thou art, they would have made a bone-fire of it, although it co≈øt ≈øo deare as it did. Now let me further tell thee (reader) veiw but that pamphlet, and this la≈øt of his at Bruges, and you ≈øhall ≈øee, that he labours covertly to di≈øtroy this Kings intere≈øt in all States, under covert of the fredome of the people of England, crying it up, which the world knows cannot be with out their King, as well as a King con≈øi≈øts in the ≈øafety of his people, but not a word of a crowne, or King, (except in detraction and deri≈ø≈øion thereof) in all his workes, O that is contrary to the motions of his Spirit: which now he would fayn vaile over to cheat true hearts out of their under≈øtandings, and if you plea≈øe impartialy to view Mr Lyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borns de≈øignes in the la≈øt page of his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Mr. D D, wherein he confe≈ø≈øeth, the Dutch may be angry with him &amp;c: (a guilty con≈øcience needs no accu≈ø≈øer) but ≈øayeth Mr. Lylborne there he is no hearty enemy of the Dutch, but a true borne Engli≈øh-man, and truly if all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gli≈øhmen
